# Purpose 
The Purpose of this project was to evaluate the effectiveness of ML models in determining credit card risk using a dataset from LendingClub. 
This project consists of 4 deliverables:

* Deliverable 1: Use Resampling Models to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 2: Use the SMOTEENN Algorithm to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 3: Use Ensemble Classifiers to Predict Credit Risk
* Deliverable 4: A Written Report on the Credit Risk Analysis (README.md)

## Results

Describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models. 
* Accuracy is the percentage of correct predictions for the test data. (Accuracy = Correct Predictions / Total Predictions) 
* Precision is a measure of how reliable a positive classification is. Precision = True Positives / (True Positives + False Positives).
* Sensitivity (Recall) is a measure of how accurate the model is in predicting the percentage of true positives that were correctly identified.         Sensitivity = True Positives / (True Positives + False Negatives)
